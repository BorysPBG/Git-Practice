      Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are
      currently recognised: the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">

      </a>
      (<em>Loxodonta </em> africana), the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant">

      </a>
      (L. cyclotis), and the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant">
        Asian elephant
      </a>
      (<em>Elephas </em> maximus). They are the only surviving members of the
      family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include
      mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long
      proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and
      tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and
      water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the
      incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and
      digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body
      temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger
      ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and
      convex or level backs.
